<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially requested to launch/deploy the application. After an initial attempt with an internal deployment tool was deemed unsatisfactory by the user, the request evolved. The user then asked for instructions to deploy the application from their GitHub repository. The requirements were further refined to need an always-on service, and finally, a service that specifically caters to the Spanish market (servers in Spain, GDPR compliance, Spanish support, payment in euros). The final goal became preparing the project for deployment on a Spanish hosting provider, Clouding.io, using Docker.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and an Expo (for web) frontend. The codebase has been prepared for deployment on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) like Clouding.io. The agent has created the following configuration files:
-   A  to containerize the backend application.
-   A  to orchestrate the backend, frontend, and a MongoDB database service.
-   An  file to act as a reverse proxy.
-   A detailed, step-by-step deployment guide in Spanish: .

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was creating a comprehensive deployment guide and all the necessary configuration files (Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx) to allow the user to deploy their application on Clouding.io, a Spanish hosting provider.
-   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N/A (The task was to create configuration and documentation, not to perform the deployment itself).
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Manual testing by user. The user needs to follow the created guide  on the external Clouding.io platform. If issues arise, the agent may need to debug based on user-provided logs.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending technical issues or bugs within the code. The only pending item is the actual deployment by the user on the chosen hosting platform.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress. The preparation phase is complete.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **P0: User Deployment on Clouding.io:** The user needs to follow the instructions in  to set up their server on Clouding.io and deploy the application using the provided Docker and Nginx configuration files. The agent's role is to support the user if they encounter problems during this process.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Consultation on Hosting:** Analyzed user requirements and guided the user through selecting an appropriate hosting provider, moving from a generic solution to Railway, and finally settling on Clouding.io to meet specific regional needs.
- **Dockerization:**
    - Created  to containerize the FastAPI backend.
- **Deployment Orchestration:**
    - Created  to manage the backend, frontend, and MongoDB services.
- **Web Server Configuration:**
    - Created  for reverse proxy setup.
- **Documentation:**
    - Created a detailed Spanish deployment guide: .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. The initial deployment issue was bypassed by adopting a new, user-approved deployment strategy.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
-   **Frontend:** Expo for Web (React Native)
-   **Database:** MongoDB
-   **Deployment:** Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx on a VPS (targetting Clouding.io)

**key DB schema**
Not detailed in this session, but the application uses MongoDB. The  file sets up a  service.

**changes in tech stack**
No changes to the core application stack. The significant addition is the deployment technology stack: **Docker, Docker Compose, and Nginx**, chosen to facilitate deployment on a flexible IaaS platform like Clouding.io.

**All files of reference**
-   : The primary deliverable. A step-by-step guide for the user to deploy the application on Clouding.io.
-   : Defines the container image for the Python backend.
-   : Orchestrates the multi-container application (frontend, backend, database).
-   : Configures the Nginx reverse proxy to direct traffic to the correct services.
-   : Updated to reflect the final deployment strategy.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
None identified.

**key api endpoints**
- : A health check endpoint on the backend was verified during the initial diagnosis.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
The user's primary goal is to deploy their application on a hosting service that fully complies with Spanish regulations and preferences (servers in Spain, GDPR compliance, Spanish support). The agent has successfully guided the user to select **Clouding.io** and has provided all the necessary configuration files and a detailed guide () for a Docker-based deployment.

Your next task is likely to be assisting the user as they follow this guide. The deployment is manual from the user's side and happens outside this environment. Be prepared to answer questions about server setup, Docker commands, or Nginx configuration based on the provided guide.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **Si**: User agrees to proceed with the Clouding.io plan.
2.  **Las 5**: User confirms that all 5 criteria (servers in Spain, EUR payment, GDPR, Spanish support, other) are important for their choice of hosting.
3.  **Es para España la web necesito otra forma de hacerlo**: A critical pivot. The user rejects the Railway plan because the website is for a Spanish audience, requiring a different solution.
4.  **Procedemos**: User agrees to the agent's plan to prepare the repository for deployment on Railway.
5.  **Quiero que sea una página web siempre activa**: User specifies a requirement for an always-on service, invalidating the free-tier Render option.
6.  **La mejor opción calidad precio**: User asks for the most cost-effective hosting option.
7.  **Con la opción de deploy ya lo intenté y no funciona de el todo bien dame instrucciones para crear la página con el archivo de github**: User rejects the initial deployment method and requests instructions for deploying from GitHub.
8.  **Vamos con el lanzamiento**: Initial request to start the deployment.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**: None.
-   **Mocked**: None.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Hosting (Target):** Clouding.io (Spanish IaaS provider).
-   **Database:** MongoDB.

**Testing status**
